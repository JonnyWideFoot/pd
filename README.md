PD is a highly modular, cross-platform molecular mechanics suite for Python. 
The library design is focused on providing unprecedented flexibility, modularity 
and adaptability without compromising speed of execution. The core algorithms 
are written in C++ for maximum efficiency and make extensive use of 
object-oriented design patterns. All features are automatically wrapped into 
Python using SWIG, a widely used wrapper generator, circumventing the need for 
the developer to know anything about the exporting process while still allowing 
Python to be used as the input script language. This allows the user to set up 
simple simulations quickly and easily while providing powerful language features 
for the more advanced user. All abstract concepts in molecular simulations such 
as force fields and simulation methods are represented by classes which interact 
with one another in a highly modular fashion, allowing the user to create new 
algorithms without coding a single line of C++. For the developer the object 
oriented design of the core library allows easy reuse of code and rapid development 
and testing of new algorithms hence accelerating scientific progress. Furthermore, 
it is possible to write separate modules which interact with the core library but 
are separately compiled and maintained and enable scientific groups to provide 
new algorithms to the code base without the need for code patches to the core 
library. At this early stage, the library already provides a large number of 
widely used features: Various molecular dynamics protocols (e.g. Replica Exchange 
Simulation) and Monte Carlo algorithms as well as methods for free-energy 
calculation, quasi-harmonic and normal mode analysis, have been implemented; 
Algorithms for homology modeling and docking are under development. Commonly 
used force fields AMBER, CHARMM and OPLS are currently supported, including 
periodic boundary simulations. Implicit solvation, such as surface area based 
models and Generalized-Born solvent models are also implemented.


FEATURES


Written in C++, wrapped into Python

Exposure into Python allows very simple as well as highly complex use of the 
features giving the user a maximum of flexibility when setting up simulations.
The design allows classes to recombine into novel algorithms at runtime (i.e. from python).
Interface generated automatically using SWIG: No need to write interface code 
after a new feature is added.

Forcefield functional forms: 

Bonded: Harmonic Bonds & Angles, Fourier & Harmonic Torsions & Impropers
NonBonded: Lennard Jones Van der Waals, Simple Electrostatics. Energy and Force switching.
Spaces: Periodic boundary conditions (Orthogonal)
Solvation: Distance-dependent Dielectric Constant, Solvent Accessible Surface 
           Area (SASA) based solvation, Generalised Born / Surface Area (GB/SA)
Knowledge Based: Residue-Residue Interaction matrix based
Restraints: Harmonic Cartesian, Distance & Torsion Restraints & various other custom forces.
Other: Go forcefield, Softcore VdW Forcefield
OpenMP allows parallelism of NonBonded calculations across the CPUs of Multicore/MultiCPU machines.
